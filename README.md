# React Material UI Controls For Power Apps!

My goal is to take as many controls from the [Material UI Core](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/) library as possible and bring them into Power Apps. For now, I'm just focusing on supporting canvas apps.

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/connorI55/MUI_PowerAppsControls/wiki) for more details!
